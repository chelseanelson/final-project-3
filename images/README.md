## Images

Contains figures and images used through the model building process 

### Documents

`canceled_balanced_distribution_plot.png` : figure showcasing the distribution of the response variable for our updated and created dataset (`data/hotel_small.rds`)

`canceled_og_distribution_plot.png` : figure showcasing the distribution of the response variable for the original data (`data/hotel_booking.csv`)

### Folders 

`bivariate_plots/` : contains bivariate plots for variables

`univariate_plots/` : contains univariate plots for variables 

`autoplots/` : contains the plots of the range of hyperparameters for tuning models 

### Acknowledgement

Most of the figures generated during the analysis are in PNG format. You can explore them separately or follow the order of our analysis by observing each variable's distribution in the univariate directory and progressing through the subsequent figures.
